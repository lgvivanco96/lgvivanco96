Hola!, I'm Lucas. 
I'm interested in everything related to earth/enviromental sciences and engineering, mainly in the physical process of the atmosphere, land, ice, ocean and all the process that those systems are coupled. Based upon the knowledge given by those fields i'm interested in all kind of applications meant to deal with the conservation of our planet and sustainable development.

I've studied enviromental and water resources engineering with a MSc. in Meteorology and Climatology. Specifically I'm intersted
in physical based numerical and statistical models, and their applications in research, forecasts, risk managment, sustaintability,
territorial planning and all kind of technological applications, especially those aimed to improve life quality and the ecological relationship between human beings and their enviroment. Despite my interest in office/computation work I also heavily enjoy field work!, for example things like the collection of new data and the maintenance or installation of new instruments.
