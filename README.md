Hola!, I'm Lucas. 
I'm interested in everything related to earth/enviromental sciences and engineering, mainly in the physical process of the atmosphere, land, ice, ocean and all the process that those systems are coupled. Based upon the knowledge given by those fields i'm interested in all kind of applications meant to deal with the conservation of our planet and a sustainable development.
I've studied enviromental and water resources engineering, and right now I'm finishing my MSc. in Meteorology and Climatology. Specifically I'm intersted
in physical based numerical and statistical models, and their applications in pure science, forecasts, risk managment, sustaintability,
territorial planning and all kind of technological applications, mainly those aimed to improve life quality and the ecological relationship between human beings and their enviroment. I'm currently interested in applications of regional hydrological, atmospheric and oceanic models like VIC, WRF, FVCOM, etc. And also in new statistical techniques (machine learning related) for data analysis and remote sensing.
