Hi, I'm Lucas. 
I'm interested in everything related to earth sciences, mainly in the physical process of the atmosphere, land, ice, ocean and all the process that those
systems are coupled.
I've studied enviromental and water resources engineering, and right now I'm finishing my MSc. in Meteorology and Climatology. Specifically I'm intersted
in physical based numerical and statistical models, and their applications in science, technology, forecasts, risk managment, sustaintability and
territorial planning. I'm currently learning how to run regional atmospheric models (WRF), hydrological (VIC, WEAP, etc), hydrogeological (MODFLOW) and
new statistical techniques (machine learning related).
